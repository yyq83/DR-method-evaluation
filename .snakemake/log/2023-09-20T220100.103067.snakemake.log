Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

Removing output files of failed job run_method_pre since they might be corrupted:
Evaluation/HGIMC_Cdataset.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
